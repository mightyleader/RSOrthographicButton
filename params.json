{"name":"RSOrthographicbutton","tagline":"A FlatUI-style UIButton subclass, UIAppearance compliant.","body":"RSOrthographicButton\r\n====================\r\n\r\nA FlatUI-style UIButton subclass, UIAppearance compliant.\r\n\r\nGood for iOS5 and above... currently tested in iOS6.1.2 and working fine...\r\n\r\nFree to use/amend for personal or commercial use. \r\nAll I ask is that I get a credit somewhere in the app or app store description, \r\nthat you let me know and don't mind me mentioning you using it in blogs, social postings etc...\r\n\r\nUsing RSOrthographicButton\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can either add it straight to you .xib file by dragging in a UIButton an dthen changing the class to RSOrthographicButton\r\nor you can instantiate in code with initWithFrame:\r\n\r\nSince it's a UIButton subclass it's got all the rest of the standard behaviour.\r\n\r\nConfiguring RSOrthographicButton\r\n--------------------------------\r\nCheck the header for the full lowdown on configurable properties and which are UIAppearance compliant.\r\nHowever if you like to be told what to do, and I know I do....\r\n\r\n**NSInteger shadowDrawnOffset** - the offset value for the shadow, applied to both x and y position (hence orthographic)\r\n\r\n**CGFloat   shadowAlpha**       - opacity of the shadow \r\n\r\n**NSInteger cornerButtonRadius**      - applied to both the button and the shadow\r\n\r\n**UIColor   *buttonColor**      - The unselected/highlighted button colour\r\n\r\n**UIColor   *selectColor**      - The highlighted/selected button colour\r\n\r\n**UIColor   *shadowColor**      - The colour of the shadow\r\n\r\nUIAppearance compliance\r\n-----------------------\r\nIn short, yes. Thanks to some good advice on NSHipster [here](http://nshipster.com/uiappearance/).\r\nYou can call the accessors of any of the above properties from the UIAppearance proxy and it'll behave.\r\nRead the docs on UIAppearance as it's something we should all be doing...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
